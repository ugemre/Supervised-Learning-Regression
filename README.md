# Supervised-Learning-Regression

*Introduction: Main Objective of the Analysis*
In this project our main object is implementing linear regression models on a house pricing data set. The project's will focus on prediction. After preprocessing, we will use simple linear regression and then will use Ridge and LASSO regularizations.

*Brief Description of Data Set and Summary of Attributes*
The data set which is used for this project was obtained from kaggle web site: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

According to the data set we have a taget value called "SalePrice" and it shows the property's sale price in dollars. When it comes to attributes, we have 81 columns which include both numeric and categoric values.

*The first ten attributes and their explanations is seen below.*

-MSSubClass: The building class
-MSZoning: The general zoning classification
-LotFrontage: Linear feet of street connected to property
-LotArea: Lot size in square feet
-Street: Type of road access
-Alley: Type of alley access
-LotShape: General shape of property
-LandContour: Flatness of the property
-Utilities: Type of utilities available
